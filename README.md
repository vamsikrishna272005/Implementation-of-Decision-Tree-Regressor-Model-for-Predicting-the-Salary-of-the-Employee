# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Prepare your data -Collect and clean data on employee salaries and features -Split data into training and testing sets
2. Define your model -Use a Decision Tree Regressor to recursively partition data based on input features -Determine maximum depth of tree and other hyperparameters
3. Train your model -Fit model to training data -Calculate mean salary value for each subset
4. Evaluate your model -Use model to make predictions on testing data -Calculate metrics such as MAE and MSE to evaluate performance
5. Tune hyperparameters -Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve performance
6. Deploy your model Use model to make predictions on new data in real-world application.
